**秋雨圣约教会代祷信32号**
**Early Rain Covenant Church Prayer Update #32**

教会会友苟中灿弟兄于3月15日在浙江访友失联后，18日有人在杭州火车东站看见他被多名便衣警察押着，剃了头发戴着手铐，不知将被带往何处。

苟弟兄曾为记者，23岁时因人权报道写作获刑十年，在狱中备受折磨，终在绝望之中呼求上帝，获释之后来到教会委身，并在基督和福音里得自由得释放。如今身陷急难，愿上帝保守他，以慈爱环绕他，赐给他属天的平安！

连日来弟兄姐妹们被逼迫搬家、被派出所和国保约谈时有发生，有些家庭仍然是被24小时监控和跟踪。梁华利弟兄、戴志超弟兄和李子虎长老取保候审后被送回原籍，苟弟兄和潘弟兄又被羁押。刑事拘留的牧长同工和弟兄姐妹仍然有11位，1位姊妹被行政拘留。我们许多弟兄姐妹为福音受苦难，“甚至被捆绑像犯人一样，但上帝的道却不会被捆绑”！

感恩众教会和弟兄姐妹们继续为我们代祷，也为包括执政掌权者在内的万人恳求祷告，因为上帝愿意万人得救明白真道。愿我们一同忍耐，直到主来。“看哪，农夫忍耐等候地里宝贵的出产，直到得了秋雨春雨”，愿我们在这片土地上一同向下扎根、向上结果！

Early Rain Covenant Church Prayer Update #32

Church member Gou Zhongcan, with whom we lost contact while he was visiting a friend in Zhejiang on March 15th, was seen on March 18th at the Hangzhou East Train Station being escorted by multiple plainclothes police officers. His head was shaved and he was handcuffed. We do not know where he was being taken.

Brother Gou used to be a reporter. When he was 23 years old, he was imprisoned for ten years for writing an article about human rights. While in prison, he was greatly tormented. He called out to God in the midst of his despair. After he was released, he came to our church and became a member. Here he found true freedom in Christ and in the gospel. May God protect him in the midst of this tribulation. May the Lord surround him with steadfast love and give him heavenly peace!

For the past few days, brothers and sisters have been forcefully evicted from their homes and spoken to by police and national security officers. Some families are still being monitored and followed 24/7. Brother Liang Huali, brother Dai Zhichao, and Elder Li Zihu were sent back to their hometowns after being released on bail pending trial. Brother Gou and brother Pan have been imprisoned again. Eleven leaders, staff, and other members still remain in criminal detention. One sister remains in administrative detention. Many of our brothers and sisters are suffering for the gospel, “bound with chains as a criminal. But the word of God is not bound!”

We are thankful for all of the churches and brothers and sisters who continue to pray for us and for all of the authorities in power, for God desires all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. May we wait patiently together for the coming of the Lord. “See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient about it, until it receives the early and the late rains.” May we plant our roots into this soil together and bear fruit!
