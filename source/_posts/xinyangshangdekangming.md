**我的声明：信仰上的抗命**

***王怡牧师***

根据圣经的教导和福音的使命，我尊重上帝在中国设立的掌权者。因为废王、立王，都在于上帝。为此，我顺服上帝对中国历史和制度的安排。
作为基督教会的一位牧师，我从圣经出发，对社会、政治、法律诸领域，何为公义的秩序和良善的治理，皆有自己的理解和看法。同时，我对中共政权迫害教会、剥夺人类的信仰和良心自由的罪恶，充满厌恶和痛恨。但是，一切社会和政治制度的改变，都不是我蒙召的使命，也不是福音被赐给上帝百姓的目的。
因为，一切现实的丑陋、政治的不义和法律的专断，都显明了耶稣基督的十字架，才是每个中国人所必须的、唯一的拯救。也显明了真正的盼望和完美的人类社会，并不存在于地上的任何制度和文化的改变中，而单单在于人的罪恶如何被基督白白赦免，得着永生的盼望。
作为一位牧师，我对福音的笃信和对众人的教导，及对一切罪恶的责备，都出于基督在福音里的命令，出于那位荣耀君王的无法测度的爱。每个人的生命都如此短暂，而上帝如此迫切地命令教会，去带领和呼召任何愿意悔改的人向他悔改。基督如此迫切的、乐意赦免一切从罪恶中回转的人。这是教会在中国的一切工作的目的，就是向世界见证基督，向中国见证天国，向属地的短暂生活见证属天的永恒生活。这也是我本人所蒙的牧职呼召。
为此，我接受和尊重中共政权是上帝所允许的暂时的统治者，如同主的仆人约翰．加尔文所说，邪恶的统治者是上帝对邪恶的人民的惩罚，目的是催逼上帝的百姓向他悔改。为此，我乐意在身体上服从他们的执法行为，如同服从主的管教和训练。
我同时相信，中共政权对教会的逼迫是极其邪恶的犯罪行为。作为基督教会的牧师，我必须对这样的罪恶发出严厉和公开的责备。我所蒙的呼召，也要求我以一种非暴力的形式，在和平和忍耐中，去违背那些违背了圣经和上帝的一切人间法律。我的救主基督也要求我，喜乐地承受违背恶法的一切代价。
但这这并不意味着，我个人和教会的抗命行为，是任何一种意义上的维权行为或公民不服从的政治行动。因为我完全无意于去改变中国的任何制度和法律。作为牧师，我唯一关心的，乃是信仰上的抗命，所带来的对罪恶人性的震动，和对基督十字架的见证。
作为一位牧师，我的抗命行为是福音使命的一部份。基督的大使命要求我们对世界的大抗命。抗命的目的不是改变这个世界，而是见证另一个世界。
因为教会的使命，仅仅是成为教会，而不成为任何世俗体制的一部份。从消极的角度说，教会必须将自己从世界分别出来，避免让自己被这个世界体制化。从积极的角度说，教会的一切行动，都是努力向这个世界，证明另一个世界的真实存在。圣经教导我们，在关乎福音和人类良心的事务上，只能顺从神，不能顺从人。因此，信仰上的抗命和肉体上的忍耐，都是我们见证另一个世界和另一位君王的方式。
这是为什么，我对改变中国的任何政治和法律制度并不感兴趣，甚至对中共政权迫害教会的政策何时会改变也不感兴趣。无论我活在现在或将来的任何政权之下，只要世俗政府继续迫害教会，戕害唯独属于上帝的人类良心，我就将继续信仰上的抗命。因为上帝赋予我的全部使命，只藉着我的一切行动，好叫更多的中国人明白，人类和社会的盼望，仅仅在于基督的救赎，在于上帝超自然的恩典掌权。
如果上帝决定藉着中共政权对教会的迫害，来帮助更多的中国人对前途绝望，带领他们经历信仰的幻灭与荒漠，从而认识耶稣，并不断熬炼和建造他自己的教会。我十分乐意顺服上帝的安排，因为他的安排总是慈爱而美善的。
正因为我的一切言行，并不寻求和期待社会和政治层面的任何改变；我对一切社会政治的权势，也不再存畏惧之心。因为圣经教导说，上帝设立政府的权柄，是叫作恶的人惧怕，不是叫行善的人惧怕。信耶稣的人，并没有作恶，也就不应惧怕黑暗的权势。尽管我是常常软弱的，但我笃信这是福音的应许，是我殚精竭虑，要在中国社会传扬的好消息。
我明白，这恰恰也是中共政权对一个不再惧怕它的教会充满了惧怕的原因。
如果我被关押或长或短的时间，能够帮助掌权者减少他们对我的信仰和我的救主的惧怕，我十分乐意以这种方式来帮助他们。但我知道，唯有当我对一—切迫害教会的罪恶说不、并以和平的方式抗命时，我才能真正帮助掌权者和执法者的灵魂。我渴望上帝使用我，以失去人身自由的方式，来告诉那些让我失去人身自由的人，有一种比他们的权柄更高的权柄存在，也有一种无法被他们关押的自由，充满了耶稣基督死而复活的教会。
无论这个政权对我加以怎样的罪名，泼以怎样的脏水，只要这罪名指向我的信仰、写作、言论和传教行为，那不过都是魔鬼的谎言和试探。我将一概予以否认，服刑而不服法，伏法而不认罪。
并且我必须指出，对主的教会和一切相信耶稣基督的中国人的迫害，才是中国社会最邪恶、最可怕的罪恶。这不但是对基督徒的犯罪，也是对一切非基督徒的犯罪。因为政府粗暴而残酷地威胁他们、阻拦他们来到耶稣面前，世上没有比这更罪大恶极的事了。
如果有一天，这个政权被上帝亲自颠覆了。不会有其他原因，必然出于上帝对这一切罪恶的公义的刑罚和报复。因为在地上，从来只有千年的教会，没有千年的政权。只有永远的信仰，没有永远的权势。
关押我的人，终将被天使关押。审问我的人，终将被基督审问。想到这一点，主使我对那些企图和正在关押我的人，不能不充满同情和悲伤。求主使用我，赐我忍耐和智慧，好将福音带给他们。
使我妻离子散，使我身败名裂，使我家破人亡，这些掌权者都可以做到。然而，使我放弃信仰，使我改变生命，使我从死里复活，这些世上却无人能做到。
既然如此，尊敬的官长们，停止作恶吧，这并不是为我的益处，而是为你们和你们子孙的益处。我苦苦地劝你们住手，因为你们何必为我这样一个卑微的罪人，而情愿付上永远沉沦地狱的代价呢？
耶稣是基督，是永生上帝的儿子。他为罪人而死，为我们而复活。昨日、今日，直到永远，他都是我的君王和整个世界的主。我是他的仆人，为此被羁押。我将温柔地去反抗一切反抗上帝的人，我将喜乐地不服从任何不服从上帝的法律。

English Version:

My Declaration of Faithful Disobedience

On the basis of the teachings of the Bible and the mission of the gospel, I respect the authorities God has established in China. For God deposes kings and raises up kings. This is why I submit to the historical and institutional arrangements of God in China.

As a pastor of a Christian church, I have my own understanding and views, based on the Bible, about what righteous order and good government is. At the same time, I am filled with anger and disgust at the persecution of the church by this Communist regime, at the wickedness of their depriving people of the freedoms of religion and of conscience. But changing social and political institutions is not the mission I have been called to, and it is not the goal for which God has given his people the gospel.

For all hideous realities, unrighteous politics, and arbitrary laws manifest the cross of Jesus Christ, the only means by which every Chinese person must be saved. They also manifest the fact that true hope and a perfect society will never be found in the transformation of any earthly institution or culture but only in our sins being freely forgiven by Christ and in the hope of eternal life.

As a pastor, my firm belief in the gospel, my teaching, and my rebuking of all evil proceeds from Christ’s command in the gospel and from the unfathomable love of that glorious King. Every man’s life is extremely short, and God fervently commands the church to lead and call any man to repentance who is willing to repent. Christ is eager and willing to forgive all who turn from their sins. This is the goal of all the efforts of the church in China—to testify to the world about our Christ, to testify to the Middle Kingdom about the Kingdom of Heaven, to testify to earthly, momentary lives about heavenly, eternal life. This is also the pastoral calling that I have received.

For this reason, I accept and respect the fact that this Communist regime has been allowed by God to rule temporarily. As the Lord’s servant John Calvin said, wicked rulers are the judgment of God on a wicked people, the goal being to urge God’s people to repent and turn again toward Him. For this reason, I am joyfully willing to submit myself to their enforcement of the law as though submitting to the discipline and training of the Lord.

At the same time, I believe that this Communist regime’s persecution against the church is a greatly wicked, unlawful action. As a pastor of a Christian church, I must denounce this wickedness openly and severely. The calling that I have received requires me to use non-violent methods to disobey those human laws that disobey the Bible and God. My Savior Christ also requires me to joyfully bear all costs for disobeying wicked laws.

But this does not mean that my personal disobedience and the disobedience of the church is in any sense “fighting for rights” or political activism in the form of civil disobedience, because I do not have the intention of changing any institutions or laws of China. As a pastor, the only thing I care about is the disruption of man’s sinful nature by this faithful disobedience and the testimony it bears for the cross of Christ.  

As a pastor, my disobedience is one part of the gospel commission. Christ’s great commission requires of us great disobedience. The goal of disobedience is not to change the world but to testify about another world.

For the mission of the church is only to be the church and not to become a part of any secular institution. From a negative perspective, the church must separate itself from the world and keep itself from being institutionalized by the world. From a positive perspective, all acts of the church are attempts to prove to the world the real existence of another world. The Bible teaches us that, in all matters relating to the gospel and human conscience, we must obey God and not men. For this reason, spiritual disobedience and bodily suffering are both ways we testify to another eternal world and to another glorious King.

This is why I am not interested in changing any political or legal institutions in China. I’m not even interested in the question of when the Communist regime’s policies persecuting the church will change. Regardless of which regime I live under now or in the future, as long as the secular government continues to persecute the church, violating human consciences that belong to God alone, I will continue my faithful disobedience. For the entire commission God has given me is to let more Chinese people know through my actions that the hope of humanity and society is only in the redemption of Christ, in the supernatural, gracious sovereignty of God.

If God decides to use the persecution of this Communist regime against the church to help more Chinese people to despair of their futures, to lead them through a wilderness of spiritual disillusionment and through this to make them know Jesus, if through this he continues disciplining and building up his church, then I am joyfully willing to submit to God’s plans, for his plans are always benevolent and good.

Precisely because none of my words and actions are directed toward seeking and hoping for societal and political transformation, I have no fear of any social or political power. For the Bible teaches us that God establishes governmental authorities in order to terrorize evildoers, not to terrorize doers of good. If believers in Jesus do no wrong then they should not be afraid of dark powers. Even though I am often weak, I firmly believe this is the promise of the gospel. It is what I’ve devoted all of my energy to. It is the good news that I am spreading throughout Chinese society.

I also understand that this happens to be the very reason why the Communist regime is filled with fear at a church that is no longer afraid of it.

If I am imprisoned for a long or short period of time, if I can help reduce the authorities’ fear of my faith and of my Savior, I am very joyfully willing to help them in this way. But I know that only when I renounce all the wickedness of this persecution against the church and use peaceful means to disobey, will I truly be able to help the souls of the authorities and law enforcement. I hope God uses me, by means of first losing my personal freedom, to tell those who have deprived me of my personal freedom that there is an authority higher than their authority, and that there is a freedom that they cannot restrain, a freedom that fills the church of the crucified and risen Jesus Christ.

Regardless of what crime the government charges me with, whatever filth they fling at me, as long as this charge is related to my faith, my writings, my comments, and my teachings, it is merely a lie and temptation of demons. I categorically deny it. I will serve my sentence, but I will not serve the law. I will be executed, but I will not plead guilty.

Moreover, I must point out that persecution against the Lord’s church and against all Chinese people who believe in Jesus Christ is the most wicked and the most horrendous evil of Chinese society. This is not only a sin against Christians. It is also a sin against all non-Christians. For the government is brutally and ruthlessly threatening them and hindering them from coming to Jesus. There is no greater wickedness in the world than this.

If this regime is one day overthrown by God, it will be for no other reason than God’s righteous punishment and revenge for this evil. For on earth, there has only ever been a thousand-year church. There has never been a thousand-year government. There is only eternal faith. There is no eternal power.

Those who lock me up will one day be locked up by angels. Those who interrogate me will finally be questioned and judged by Christ.  When I think of this, the Lord fills me with a natural compassion and grief toward those who are attempting to and actively imprisoning me. Pray that the Lord would use me, that he would grant me patience and wisdom, that I might take the gospel to them. 

Separate me from my wife and children, ruin my reputation, destroy my life and my family – the authorities are capable of doing all of these things. However, no one in this world can force me to renounce my faith; no one can make me change my life; and no one can raise me from the dead.   

And so, respectable officers, stop committing evil. This is not for my benefit but rather for yours and your children’s. I plead earnestly with you to stay your hands, for why should you be willing to pay the price of eternal damnation in hell for the sake of a lowly sinner such as I?

Jesus is the Christ, son of the eternal, living God. He died for sinners and rose to life for us. He is my king and the king of the whole earth yesterday, today, and forever. I am his servant, and I am imprisoned because of this. I will resist in meekness those who resist God, and I will joyfully violate all laws that violate God’s laws.  

The Lord’s servant,
Wang Yi
