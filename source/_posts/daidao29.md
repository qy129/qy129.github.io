Early Rain Covenant Church Prayer Update #29

“你们务要警醒，在真道上站立得稳，要作大丈夫，要刚强。 凡你们所做的都要凭爱心而做。” (哥林多前书 16:13-14 和合本)
秋雨圣约教会副执事、基督徒媒体人张国庆弟兄失踪多日，今天得知已被当局以“寻衅滋事”罪刑事拘留，关押于成都市看守所。
“12.9”教案发生后，张国庆弟兄被当局一直软禁在家里与外界隔绝，稍早前国庆弟兄写了一篇有关王怡牧师妻子蒋蓉师母的文章。名为《蒋蓉是才德妇人》 发布该文后国庆弟兄带着入狱的行李直奔警察局。2月24日王怡牧师年近74岁的母亲被成都汪家拐派出所警察张俊虎（警号075557）暴力殴打、侮辱，出于良知和媒体人的本能，国庆弟兄发文谴责此恶劣行径，随后被失踪直至找寻到刑事拘留的消息。
连日来的大抓捕、弟兄姐妹们受到当局各种非常人能忍受的折磨和骚扰，被殴打、被侮辱、被无端关押；被24小时监控跟踪威胁、被砸门敲门、闯入家中；被每天登门拍照、警告，随时传唤问话；透过向房东施压、向工作单位施压而被失去工作、被失去住所；被强制遣返原籍等。
据可联系到的人员不完全统计（冰山一角），其中无法律手续被强制带入派出所的基督徒超过3百人次；8个基督徒家庭失去住所；基督徒弟兄姊妹被工作单位约谈施压10人次，2位被辞退；约百位被遣返。被成都曹家巷派出所、太升路派出所、西御河派出所、建设路派出所等警察殴打的基督徒有9人次、被语言侮辱与人格行为侮辱的基督徒9人次。如王弟兄被曹家巷派出所警察扇耳光、被建设路派出所严重拖伤，侮辱若干次，Tang姊妹在哺乳期怀中抱着孩子被曹家巷派出所警察殴打，约12小时。尚在哺乳期被警察强制与婴儿分离关押时间超过6小时以上有2人次、处于哺乳期被关押姊妹8人次、关押过派出所的14岁以下儿童幼童约30多人次（关押幼童均超过8小时，最长达72小时，最小幼童不满1岁）。
刑事拘留25人，仍在关押中的12名、行政拘留共23人次，仍在拘留期间的11名、失踪1人。
刑事拘留关押中的12名：
王怡牧师（煽动颠覆国家政权罪，2018年12月9日 秘密关押）
蒋蓉师母（煽动颠覆国家政权罪，12月10日，秘密关押）
李英强长老（寻衅滋事罪，12月11日 关押于成都市看守所 ）

李子虎长老（寻衅滋事罪，12月12日 ）

失踪1人
杨建弟兄 2月24日 可能被行政拘留10天，但没有收到任何告知书，家人去拘留所没有找到。
请为被关押的弟兄姐妹和被持续监控不堪骚扰的弟兄姐妹们祷告，靠主刚强、忍耐、谨守，不至被引动失去福音的盼望！让我们定睛在舍命买赎我们、又复活升天、并会荣耀再来的救主基督耶稣身上！
帮助我们以主耶稣爱我们的爱，来爱仇敌、为逼迫我们的祷告！
请为执行任务警察、社区人员、工作单位和房东祷告，按照良知和法律行事。凡违背法律和违背良心的方式执行任务的，必会陷入自己所掘的坑中，缠在自己暗设的网罗里。

Early Rain Covenant Church Prayer Update #29
“‘Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong. Let all that you do be done in love.’ (1 Cor. 16:13-14)
Early Rain Covenant Church deacon and Christian journalist Zhong Guoqing has been missing for a number of days. Today we learned that authorities have placed him in criminal detention on charges of ‘picking quarrels and provoking trouble.’ He is being held at the Chengdu City Detention Center.
After the ‘12/9’ persecution began, brother Zhang Guoqing was paced under house arrest by authorities at his home and cut off from the outside world. A while ago, Brother Guoqing wrote an article about Pastor Wang Yi’s wife Jiang Rong titled ‘Jiang Rong Is a Woman of Talent and Virtue.’ After publishing this article, brother Guoqing went straight to the police station, bringing with him a bag he had prepared to take into prison. On February 24th, Pastor Wang Yi’s nearly 74-year-old mother was humiliated and violently beaten by officer Zhang Junhu (officer ID: 075557) of the Wang Jiaguai police station. Brother Guoqing, spurred by his conscience and his journalistic instincts, published an article condemning these abominable acts. He then disappeared until we received news about him being charged with ‘picking quarrels and provoking trouble.’
Day after day throughout this persecution, brothers and sisters have been persecuted by authorities in ways that no ordinary person could endure. They have been harassed, beaten, humiliated, and locked up without cause. They have been monitored, followed, and threatened 24/7. Authorities have broken down their doors and barged into their homes. They have been visited, photographed, and warned every day. They have been called to the police station at random for questioning. Authorities have pressured landlords and employers, causing these Christians to lose their jobs and their homes. They have been forced to move back to their hometowns. The list goes on.
According to incomplete statistics gathered through contacting those whom we could contact (this is only the tip of the iceberg), more than three hundred people have been unlawfully taken to the police station. Eight Christian families have lost their homes. The employers of ten Christians have been spoken to and pressured by authorities. Two of these Christians have lost their jobs. Around one hundred Christians have been sent back to their hometowns. Nine Christians have been beaten by police from the Caojiaxiang Police Station, the Taisheng Road Police Station, the Xiyuhe Police Station, and the Jianshe Road Police Station. Nine Christians have been verbally or physically humiliated. For example, brother Wang was slapped in the face by officers from the Caojiaxiang Police Station and severely injured and humiliated multiple times by officers from the Jianshe road Police Station; sister Tang, who is nursing, was beaten for around twelve hours by police from the Caojiaxiang Police Station while holding her child in her arms. Police have forcefully separated two nursing mothers from their children for more than six hours. A total of eight nursing mothers have been locked up. More than thirty children under fourteen years old have been locked up at the police station (on average, they were locked up for more than eight hours, the longest time being seventy-two hours; the youngest child was not yet one year old).
Of the twenty-five Christians who have been placed in criminal detention, twelve still remain locked up. Of the twenty-three Christians placed in administrative detention, eleven remain locked up. One person has disappeared.
The twelve Christians in criminal detention:
1. Pastor Wang Yi (inciting to subvert state power, 12/9/18, in secret detention)
2. Pastor’s wife Jiang Rong (inciting to subvert state power, 12/10/18, in secret detention)
3. Elder Li Yingqiang (picking quarrels and provoking trouble, 12/11/18, detained at Chengdu City Detention Center)
4. Elder Qin Defu (illegal business operations)
5. Elder Su Bingsen (picking quarrels and provoking trouble, 12/15/18, detained at Chengdu City Detention Center)
6. Deacon Ge Yingfeng (illegal business operations, 12/9/18)
7. Sister Li Xiaofeng (illegal business operations, 12/9/18)
8. Brother Liang Huali (illegal business operations, detained at Chengdu City Detention Center)
9. Brother Ding Shuqi (originally lost contact for a long time, now we have confirmed that he has been detained)
10. Brother Dai Zhichao (picking quarrels and provoking trouble, 12/19/18, detained at Chengdu City Detention Center)
11. Elder Li Zihu (picking quarrels and provoking trouble, 12/12/18)
12. Brother Zhang Guoqing (picking quarrels and provoking trouble, 2/24/19)
The eleven Christians in administrative detention:
1. Brother A-Xin (2/24/19, detained for 10 days)
2. Brother Zhang Jianqing (2/24/19, detained for 14 days)
3. Sister Yu Zhixue (2/24/19, detained for 14 days)
4. Brother Hou Hongen (2/24/19, detained for 14 days)
5. Brother Luo Zhipeng (2/24/19, detained for 14 days)
6. Sister Yang Duli (2/24/19, detained for 14 days)
7. Brother Zhu Xiaoguang (2/24/19, detained for 14 days)
8. Brother Zhang Guanya (2/24/19, detained for 14 days)
9. Brother Huang Guangtai (2/24/19, detained for 14 days)
10. Brother Zhang Qi (2/24/19, detained for 14 days)
11. Brother Tang Chunliang (2/24/19, beaten by police, condition unknown, detained for 14 days)
The one who has gone missing:
Brother Yang Jian (2/24/19, possibly placed in administrative detention for 10 days, but we have received no notice; his family has visited the detention center and could not find him)
Please pray for those brothers and sisters who are locked up and for those who are being continually monitored and mercilessly harassed. Ask that they would rely on the Lord for strength, endurance, and faithfulness and that they would not lose hope in the gospel! May we look to the one who gave his life for us, who redeemed us, who rose from the dead, who ascended into heaven, and who will come again in glory—the Lord Jesus Christ!
Ask the Lord to help us to love our enemies as the Lord Jesus loved us and to pray for those who are persecuting us!
Please pray for those police officers, community officers, employers, and landlords who are doing their duties, that they would act according to their consciences and the law. Those who do their duties while violating the law and their consciences will fall into the pits they have dug and will get caught in the snares they have laid.

国庆弟兄，
每一次在你家门口吃跷脚牛肉，你总是为我点一大盘香葱牛肉沫蛋炒饭；每一次你总忍口给我盛一大碗，你添小半碗，盘子里留下的都盛给我；你不曾问过我是否喜欢。因为你看着我吃蛋炒饭的样子，你很喜欢。
每一次你都请我吃跷脚牛肉，每一次你都点下一大盘葱香牛肉沬蛋炒饭，每一次我都会光盘。
今天我一个人在你家门口，我点了一锅跷脚牛肉，一大份葱香牛肉沫蛋炒饭。
你在成都市看守所，我在你家门口。两个男人的约会，今天你爽了约……
国庆弟兄，
我忘不了春节前你在吃跷脚牛肉时的饭前祷告时说的一句话：主啊，请差我去代弟兄姊妹坐牢吧！这是你的恩典，因为我最有条件去坐牢！
 我深深的知道你说的条件是什么，你多次告诉我你了无牵挂，无妻儿老小，孑然一身。
虽然我俩同龄，虽然我总催你找女朋友，并承诺给你筹办婚礼。可每一次你都笑而不语，象个孩子般莞尔的看着我。
我真后悔每一次都让你带领做餐前祷告，那一次真该我抢着做一次祷告，祈祷上帝佑国庆兄化险为夷，祈祷上帝赐给国庆兄常在常新的跷脚牛肉，赐给我俩男人约会的美好见证。
国庆弟兄，
你的执着让我俩从未换过餐厅，也从未换过菜，也从未吃过其它的的饭，也从来没有违拗你。
因为我知道，你是上帝的事工，你是上帝的肢体，我拗不过你，欣然顺服，虽然你常谦卑的叫我大哥。
可此时我只想端一碗牛肉汤，从家门口送到成都看守所！
​
