秋雨圣约教会代祷信28号
Early Rain Covenant Church Prayer Update #28
24日，在上帝赐下的安息日里，经历“12.9”教难重挫的肢体们依旧满怀喜乐地同往日一样来崇拜上帝。然而多个聚会家庭被警察围困敲门或进入，两个聚会家庭里的人在聚会结束后被押上等在那里的警用大巴，儿童、老人、孕妇基督徒一并被警察带走，手机都被当场扣押不得使用。
翻译家阿信弟兄得知弟兄姊妹们在家庭聚会儿童、老人、孕妇被抓捕，以及王怡牧师年74岁的母亲被警察侮辱、殴打而奋笔疾书，傍晚被近十名警察从家中抓捕。
截至昨晚8点，在“2.24"主日崇拜大抓捕中，我们有44名肢体被抓捕，其中有11名儿童，被关押进成都的派出所，最小的婴儿才2个多月。汤春亮夫妇在派出所被一个便衣打耳光，有些人包括孩子都没有吃饭，有些到凌晨2点才被放回家中，孩子困了就睡在冰冷的桌子上和地上，有些到早上6点才回到家中。
目前11人确定被行政拘留。他们是：
阿 信弟兄 拘留10天
张建青弟兄 拘留14天
尉志雪姊妹 拘留14天
朱晓光弟兄 拘留14天
侯宏恩弟兄 拘留14天
雒志鹏弟兄 拘留14天
杨都丽姊妹 拘留14天
张冠亚弟兄 拘留14天
黄光泰弟兄 拘留14天
汤春亮弟兄 拘留14天
杨健弟兄 拘留10天
今天又陆续有弟兄姐妹从家中被带走。撰写此代祷信时，仍不时有新的状况发生，多个家庭再次被威胁、搜查。

Early Rain Covenant Church Prayer Update #28
"On February 24th, church members who have experienced many setbacks throughout the ‘12/9’ persecution still came together full of joy to worship God during his Sabbath. Police, however, surrounded multiple homes holding gatherings and either knocked on their doors or entered. At two home gatherings, everyone there was detained after the meeting ended. They then waited for the police bus to arrive. Everyone, including Christian children, elderly people, and pregnant women, was taken away by police, and their phones were seized.
Brother A-Xin, a translator, after hearing about children, elderly people, and pregnant women being arrested at home gatherings and about Wang Yi’s 74-year-old mother being insulted and beaten, took up his pen and began writing furiously. In the evening, he was arrested at his home by nearly ten police officers.
By 8:00 p.m. last night, 44 members had been arrested during the ‘2/24’ Sabbath raids. Of those arrested, 11 were children. The youngest to be detained and taken to the police station was a little more than two months old. Tang Chunliang and his wife were hit in the face by a plainclothes police officer at the police station. Some, including children, did not eat anything. Some were not released until 2:00 a.m. Tired children slept on ice-cold tables and floors. Others were not released until 6:00 a.m.
At the moment, we have confirmed that at least 11 people have been placed in administrative detention. They include the following:
Brother A-Xin (detained for 10 days)
Brother Zhang Jianqing (detained for 14 days)
Sister Yu Zhixue (detained for 14 days)
Brother Zhu Xiaoguang (detained for 14 days)
Brother Hou Hongen (detained for 14 days)
Brother Luo Zhipeng (detained for 14 days)
Sister Yang Duli (detained for 14 days)
Brother Zhang Guanya (detained for 14 days)
Brother Huang Guangtai (detained for 14 days)
Brother Tang Chunliang (detained for 14 days)
Brother Yang Jian (detained for 10 days)
Today, brothers and sisters are still being taken from their homes. New situations are developing at the time of the writing of this letter. Multiple families are being threatened and their homes searched.

附：
昨天王怡牧师的母亲在银行拒绝警察偷看密码而被殴打的事发之后，今天已经有几位弟兄姐妹被警告不要乱说话，阿信弟兄也因此被控造谣生事而拘留10天。更令人气愤的是，汪家拐派出所的所长和打人的警察张俊虎（警号075557）不仅没有来道歉，反而是市局的警察来放了被篡改了的银行监控录像，威胁奶奶说可以按照此录像指控她袭警而抓她。
