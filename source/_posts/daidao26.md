秋雨圣约教会代祷信26号
Early Rain Covenant Church Urgent Prayer Request #26
2月22晚20:40分，“12.9”教难被囚基督徒苏炳森长老之妻苏太太及其4个小孩受当局层层施压，房东违背签订合同时的承诺催逼苏太太限期搬离。
此次被迫搬离已是这个苦难的家庭第二次经受的痛苦，孩子们抱着苏太太不停地哭泣，每当他们游离失所后找到一个新的环境适应几天后成都的警察、国保便找上门来，通过各种方式、手段驱赶这个家庭。
有警察、国保向苏太太宣布，苏炳森长老系博士学位与成都的户籍没有关系，几个孩子没有户口，属于非法人口将被剥夺居住权。
现在的住处是几天前才与房东签订的合同，房东前天收到派出所通知向苏太太表示不会听命于警察、国保，苏太太将房东坚守承诺的举动告诉给孩子们，今晚却发生房东撕毁协议的行为，孩子们无法理解接受发生这样的事情，孩子们面临来到新家却又要搬离，正在成长发育的心理缺少了这个年龄阶段孩童本该有的对家的归宿感，他们抱着自己的母亲伤心地哭泣。
祈求上帝能怜悯这些孩童和苏太太当前的处境，求圣灵与他们同在，做他们脚前的灯，照亮他们下一站的路，求主基督彰显衪的大能，在这寒冷的夜晚生起一团炭火温暖他们身体，亦温暖那些在黑暗角落里的人冰冻麻木的心。

Early Rain Covenant Church Urgent Prayer Request #26
"At 8:40 p.m. on Feb. 22, the wife of elder Su Bingsen, one of the Christians imprisoned under the ‘12/9’ persecution, along with their four children, experienced increased pressure by authorities as their landlord forced Mrs. Su to move out of her home, breaking the promise she had previously made when they signed their contract.
This is already the second time this suffering family has experienced the pain of being forced to move. Mrs. Su’s children embraced her and wept continually. Each time they are evicted, they find a new place to live. Then, after they’ve spent a few days adapting to their new home, police and national security come to their door and, through various methods, drive the family out of their home again.
Police and national security told Mrs. Su that elder Su Bingsen’s doctoral degree is not related to his registered residence in Chengdu, and none of their children has a hukou. Therefore, as illegal residents, they are being denied residency.
They had just signed a contract with their landlord for the place where they are currently living. The day before yesterday, their landlord received a notice from the police station and told Mrs. Su that she would not comply with the requests of the police and national security. Mrs. Su then told her children about the landlord’s keeping her word. But this evening, the landlord tore up their agreement. The children cannot understand or accept what is happening. They have just arrived at their new home, and now they must move out again. As these children are growing up, they do not feel the sense of belonging that children this age ought to feel in their homes. Heartbroken, they hugged their mother and wept.
Pray that God would have mercy on these children and on Mrs. Su as they deal with these circumstances. Ask the Holy Spirit to be with them and to be a lamp unto their feet, lighting the path that lies before them. Ask the Lord Christ to manifest his power, lighting a fire on this cold winter night that would warm their bodies and melt the frozen hearts of those trapped in darkness.
