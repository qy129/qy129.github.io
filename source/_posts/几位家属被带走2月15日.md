（最新消息：感谢大家的代祷，昨晚7点左右被带走的12.9教案受难者的三位妻子一位丈夫和一位孩子，今凌晨约2:40平安回到家中。谢谢大家的代祷！）

2月15日19:00时左右，“12.9”教难被囚基督徒太太们遭到成都市建设路派出所抓捕。肖红柳姊妹（覃德富长老太太）、徐苗壮姊妹（苏炳森长老太太）、陆灵芝姊妹（戴志超弟兄太太）和儿子戴以理、沈冰弟兄（李晓凤姊妹丈夫），前来抓捕的警察说，这些被囚基督徒亲属以被取缔的秋雨圣约教会名义活动，中国当局不能容忍。

她们都住在学校的一个大院里，下午带孩子们在操场一起玩，回到家中不久就被带走。戴太太是最早回家的，大约在6点多被带走，其它人大约在7点多被带走。

这次幸亏三家都有老人在照顾孩子。请为她们，还有家中的老人和孩子祷告。苏太太最小的孩子1岁10个月，戴太太最小的孩子还没断奶，从来没有离开过母亲，覃太太最小的孩子不到一岁，上一次跟妈妈一起被带进派出所就不让给她喂奶，以此要挟妈妈签字，回来后这孩子就不再喝母奶，自己给自己断了奶。

(update：the wives and husband went home peacefully at about 2:40 am. Thank you for praying!)

“At around 7:00 p.m. on Feb. 15, some wives of those Christians who are in prison as part of the 12/9 persecution were arrested by police from the Jianshe Road Police Station. They arrested sister Xiao Hongliu (Elder Qin Defu's wife), sister Xu Miaozhuang (Elder Su Bingsen's wife), sister Lu Lingzhi (brother Dai Zhichao's wife), and brother Chen Bing (sister Li Xiaofeng's husband). The police who arrested them said Chinese authorities will not tolerate these wives participating in illegal gatherings and activities under the name of 'Early Rain Covenant Church.'

They all live in a large compound near a school. They took their children to play on the sports field in the afternoon. Shortly after returning home they were taken away. The wife of Dai Zhichao was the first to return home. She was taken away at around 6:00. The others were taken away at around 7:00.

Fortunately, these three families all have elderly relatives looking after their children. Please pray for them, as well as for their elderly relatives and for their children. Xu Miaozhuang’s youngest child is one year and ten months old. Lu Lingzhi’s youngest child is still nursing and has never left his mother. Xiao Hongliu’s youngest child is not yet one year old. The last time the child was taken to the police station with her mother, they did not allow her to nurse in order to force her mother to sign a document. After they returned home, this child no longer wanted to drink her mother’s milk. She stopped nursing on her own.”
